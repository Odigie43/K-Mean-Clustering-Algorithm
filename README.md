# K-Mean-Clustering-Algorithm
I recently completed a project focused on leveraging the K-Means Clustering algorithm to perform unsupervised machine learning tasks. The project aimed to uncover hidden patterns within unlabeled data by grouping similar data points into clusters, making it possible to derive insights without prior labels or classifications.

Key aspects of the project included:

Data Segmentation: Using K-Means, I segmented large datasets into meaningful clusters based on shared characteristics, facilitating insights that would have been challenging to extract through manual analysis.
Pattern Recognition: The algorithm effectively identified distinct groups within the data, highlighting patterns that could inform decision-making and strategy in applications such as customer segmentation, market analysis, and image compression.
Cluster Validation: To ensure optimal clustering, I implemented methods to determine the ideal number of clusters, leveraging metrics like the elbow method and silhouette score.
This project showcases the power of K-Means for organizing and interpreting complex, unlabeled data, demonstrating the algorithm's utility in driving insights and supporting data-driven strategies across a range of industries.
